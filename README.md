# Lox-Intepreter
If you have not already looked at my project report, please do so, here is the link for it: https://docs.google.com/document/d/18iPiXVlDqWvjRcuAJGO1WV9SyCZjNP4TxutA8EMOCEE/edit

This project is a Lox Intepreter written in C# based on the book crafting interpreters. I only got through Chapters 4-10, but the functionalities within those chapters work with 100% success. 

I have provided three updates: one after chapters 4-6, another after chapters 7-9, and the final after chapter 10. Those updates can be seen by looking through the corresponding folders (Lox_chapter4-6, Lox_chapter 6-9, Lox_chapter 10).

My final submission with test cases included can be found in the folder named Final Submission.

Like I state above, this project was built using C#. To view this project in your preferred IDE, either open the csproj file in the Final Submission folder or download the folder and run the following command in the terminal:
    dotnet run

Once you have opened up the project, you can run the intepreter in two ways: Interactive mode or by inputting a file.
To run my interpreter in interactive mode, run the following command:
 <br>    dotnet run 

To run my interpreter by inputting a file, run the following command:
 <br>    dotnet run filename

Although it is entirely possible to run my project on your own, I've provided 4 test files and the corresponding outputs within the Final submission folder.

The test files are: testA.lox , testB.lox, testC.lox, and testD.lox
The output files correspond to each test file: outputA.txt, outputB.txt, outputC.txt, ouputD.txt
